You just have to choose the note (e.g C and â™­ / â™® / #) and the scale and it'll give you all the notes and the chords in it!
Once the chords are displayed, you can click on any of them to change their color (e.g if you found a nice progression)

 Would love any feedback, especially on the design and the user experience !!
 Hope you have fun using this ðŸ¤“


You can add any scale by addind a button in the html code with _data-scale:'scale'_  and adding the corresponding arrays in the JS code with the correct syntax ("data-scale" + Steps / Chords / Roman / Seventh [] )

I'll add some soon, I'm currently working on another project ðŸ§›
